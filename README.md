## Models for health disparity analysis 

#### Varying-coefficients for regional quantile via KNN-based LASSO with applications to health outcome study (2023+)
 * This novel framework for dynamic modeling of the associations
between health outcomes and risk factors can capture
the time-varying effects of age.

#### A quantile regression decomposition estimation of disparities for complex survey data (2023+)
 *  The method proposes a quantile regression (QR) decomposition approach to disparity research using complex survey data.

## Survival data screening in high-dimensional data 

 
#### Feature selection of ultrahigh-dimensional covariates with survival outcomes: a selective review (2017)

#### The Lq-norm learning for ultrahigh-dimensional survival data: an integrated framework (2018)
* The Lq-norm learning is proposed to detect predictors with various levels of impact, such as short- or long-term impact, on censored
outcome.

#### Integrated powered density (IPOD): screening ultrahigh dimensional covariates with survival outcome (2018)
 *  With a flexible weighting scheme, Kolmogorov statistic as a special case,  IPOD method can detect early or late impact on censored outcome.

#### Conditional screening for survival data (2018)
 * The recently developed variable screening methods, though powerful in many practical setting,  are less powerful in detecting marginally weak while jointly important signals. A new conditional screening method for survival outcome data computes the marginal contribution of each biomarker given priorly known biological information.

#### Quantile adaptive model-free variable screening for high-dimensional heterogeneous data (2013)
 * The proposed nonlinear independence screening procedure employs spline approximations to model the marginal effects at a quantile level of interest.
